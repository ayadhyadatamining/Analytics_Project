Question: Randomly generate a matrix of shape (1Million, 2) and perform below mentioned operations:

a. Find the distances between each 2-Dimensional data point from the centroid (i.e. mean) of the given dataset. Append the newly calculated distances as new column with the given dataset.

b. Given any data point, generate 3 closest neighbors from it.

Approach:

Step 1 - Randomly generate a matrix of shape 1million * 2

Step 2 - Find the centroid of the data

Step 3 - Compute the distance between 2D datapoints and centroid

Step 4 - Add the distance as a new column to our matrix
